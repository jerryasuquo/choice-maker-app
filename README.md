This is a simple decision maker app that uses React

A user is presented with a page where they can input options they can't decide on.

A user can then press a button and the web app will make the decision for them.

This web app will make use of:

- React class-based and stateless functional components
- Component props and state
- Local Storage to temporarily store data
